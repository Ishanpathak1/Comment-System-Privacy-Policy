        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 10/24/2024 </p>
        
        <p>This privacy policy explains how the Comment System extension ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the extension.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Comment System extension does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). The extension operates locally on your browser and interacts with third-party services (e.g., blockchain smart contracts) without sending personal data to any servers controlled by us.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
        <p>The following permissions are requested by the extension to function properly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Allows the extension to inject the comment system into the active tab so that you can interact with web pages.</li>
            <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Needed to modify web pages to inject the comment system.</li>
            <li><strong>storage:</strong> Used to save user settings such as visibility of comments or interaction preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Host permissions:</strong> Allows the extension to interact with web pages you visit to enable commenting functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected by the extension is solely used to enhance your browsing experience by enabling a commenting system for interacting with blockchain-based comments. No personal information is collected, stored, or transmitted.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any data with third-party companies or services. The extension interacts with public blockchain networks where data such as comments are stored but are not associated with any personal identifiers.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>The extension does not store any personal information or sensitive data. All interactions are performed client-side, ensuring that data remains secure.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and you are advised to review this page periodically for any updates.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at ishan.pathak2711@gmail.com.</p>
